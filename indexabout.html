     <h3> Ramen has taken the western world by storm, but what is this dish and what has led to it  being so popular all across the world?
        Simply put, ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavored broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg. In Japan ramen is considered a fast food, with many small restaurants and street vendors offering a warming bowl of this delicious soup. The dish of ramen is heavily regionalised, with different variations served in different areas of Japan, although all variations are based on the same broth and noodle concept.
